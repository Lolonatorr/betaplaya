# Welcome!!
**Why?**
*Do you know the feeling when a song you like gets removed or grayed out on spotify? 
Maybe you want a song that only is available on youtube music but you have everythig on spotify?
Or you are like me that wants to use songs for editing but cannot get the mp3 from spotify.
The end goal of this player is to make a music player that solves all of those problems.
Since I suck at programming this will most likely just end in a database of a folder with a bunch of mp3 files.*
## Goals of this project:
- All songs in one Folder
- Database that syncs with the folder
- Playlists with the Database
- Youtube download ?
